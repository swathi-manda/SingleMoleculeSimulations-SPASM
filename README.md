# SPASM
This repository contains files forked from **SPASM** (Software for Precise Analysis of Single Molecules) and accompanying files referenced in "Computational Tool for Ensemble Averaging of Single-Molecule Data." Thomas J. Blackwell, W. Tom Stump, Sarah R. Clippinger, and Michael J. Greenberg https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.241752v1.

And in addition it contains Matlab scripts that I am playing with to simulate single molecule and ensemble of molecules binding signal data. 
The aim of this project is to characterize the signal to noise (SNR) in single molecule experiment vs. ensemble experiments in the presence of a large dynamic range of concentration. 

The purpose here is to develop a code that takes in a input of binding affinities between molecules and sensors and generates a temporal signal (on , off) map of the simulated interaction between a single sensor and molecules in its affinity. The same exercise is then repeated for a cumulative signal of many such sensors.

NOTE:
**SPASM** is a MATLAB-based computational tool for generating ensemble averages of single-molecule data.

You can download **SPASM**, **SPASM_one_bead**, compiled versions of either program (for Windows or macOS), our program for generating simulated data, the user guide, and the data referenced in the paper [here](https://github.com/GreenbergLab/SPASM/releases/tag/v1.0).

For the standalone versions of the program: To install on Windows, run the executable. To install on Mac, unzip the file and move it to the Applications folder.
